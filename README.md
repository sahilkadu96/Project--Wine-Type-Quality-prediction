# Wine Quality Prediction
- By using Functional Model Neural Network - 2 Outputs. 
- First output is by using Regression & the second output is using Classification.




## Description

Datset fownloaded from: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)


- There are two files **winequality-red.csv** and **winequality-white.csv**
 - We will combine both datasets & will preprocess the data.
 - After that we will build a neural network model that will output the wine quality (Regression) and wine type (Classification).
 - Refer **Project Wine Quality Type Prediction.ipynb** for model building.

## Installation

Set up the  python virtual environment & activate it.

 ```bash
    py -m venv .venv
    .venv\bin\Activate.bat 
 ```

Install the requirements

```bash
  pip install requirements.txt
```


## Deployment

To deploy this app run

```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the streamlit interface in browser & we are ready to go.
